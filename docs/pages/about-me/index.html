        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>
          Born and raised in what friends have described as a 'singing cult', a majority of my youth revolved around
          musical and thespian endeavors. In my late teens, a series of curiosities led me into a digital technologies
          class. Equipped with an ability for calculus, and the creative capacity for photography, programming was an
          activity that enabled me to exploit my creative and methodical strengths; An art form with rules, yet no
          bounds. Infatuated with this new venture, my life slowly transitioned from practicing piano to programming
          Python.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since then, I've finished College, completed four years at University, and found a job as a developer.
          Today, I'm programming for a living, and for fun in my free time; Happily blurring the lines between "work"
          and "life".
