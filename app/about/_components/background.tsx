        Born and raised in what friends have described as a &apos;singing
        cult&apos;, a majority of my youth revolved around musical and thespian
        endevours. In my late teens, a series of curiosities led me into a
        digital technologies class. Equipped with an ability for calculus, and
        the creative capacity for photography, programming was an activity that
        enabled me to exploit my creative and methodical strengths; An art-form
        with rules, yet no bounds. Infatuated with this new venture, my life
        slowly transitioned from practicing piano to programming Python.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since then, I&apos;ve finished College, completed four years at
        University, and found a job as a developer. Today, I&apos;m programming
        for a living, and for fun in my free time; Happily blurring the lines
        between &quot;work&quot; and &quot;life&quot;.
