# Blog Generator

`./src` contains Node.js scripts and content for generating blog posts and tags. This functionality COULD be directly
implemented into the application (with some UI). However, a user table and authentication would be required for this. As
such, this CLI application provides the necessary functionality without the added scope creep.
