      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hailing from what my friends affectionately call a ‘singing cult,' my formative years were steeped in music and
        the performing arts. As I entered my late teens, curiosity beckoned me toward the world of digital technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Armed with a knack for calculus and a flair for photography, I discovered programming— an art form that blends
        creativity with methodical precision. It's a canvas with rules, yet near infinite possibilities. Now, I've
        traded sheet music for syntax; my compositions resonate through elegant algorithms, harmonizing data structures
        and orchestrating efficient solutions. Whether it's a symphony of APIs or a concerto in cloud architecture, I
        thrive on turning complexity into clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <span id="industry-years">X</span> years of industry experience as a Software Engineer, I am fervently
        committed to developing digital products that are synonymous with safety, reliability, and innovation. My
        technical prowess is anchored in <code class="inline">TypeScript</code>, <code class="inline">C#</code>, and
        <code class="inline">Rust</code>, complemented by a comprehensive proficiency in a wide array of technologies.
        My professional goals center around specializing in backend development, particularly in the realm of networking
        technologies. I aspire to contribute to innovations that enhance our digital connectivity and bolster security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I stand as a bright, bubbly, resilient, and reliable individual. I'm prepared to bring my distinctive mix
        of creativity and expertise to exciting projects. Are you ready for me? Welcome to my melodic journey through
        bytes and bits!

          <p class="description">
            I started my career at Z Energy fresh out of university as a graduate developer and have since progressed to
            an intermediate position. Working within New Zealand's largest fuel provider, I've been part of a dynamic
            team driving digital innovation in the energy sector. The following sections attempt to summarize the
            breadth of experience I've accumulated during my time at Z.<br /><br />
            <strong class="sub">From Code To Cloud:</strong><br />
            My experience as a developer spans a wide range of technologies. I've utilized
            <code class="inline">TypeScript</code> and <code class="inline">C#</code> to build everything from small
            Function Apps to extensive Web APIs and internal tools. In addition, I've developed infrastructure as code
            using <code class="inline">Terraform</code> to manage and link these components to Service Buses, Databases,
            Virtual Networks, and more. My experience also includes setting up CI/CD pipelines with
            <code class="inline">GitHub Actions</code> and <code class="inline">Azure DevOps Pipelines</code>, ensuring
            automated and synchronized build processes that seamlessly align our version control systems with the
            corresponding cloud services. My role truly encapsulates the journey "from code to cloud," reflecting my
            comprehensive involvement across the technological stack.<br /><br />
            <strong class="sub">Balancing Modernization and Security:</strong><br />
            In an era where the digital landscape is ever-expanding, it’s imperative to align legacy systems with
            current standards and guidelines; Safeguarding our infrastructure while preparing for future advancements.
            My work has been consistently lined with the ongoing enhancement, modernization, and stewardship of our
            existing systems.<br /><br />
            <strong class="sub">Incident Investigations:</strong><br />
            My developer duties include both team-based and individual analysis into the
            <code class="inline">Azure Portal</code>. This critical examination is directed at identifying and resolving
            discrepancies in my code as well as existing systems. By participating in these processes, I have honed my
            ability to create long-term resilience and ease of maintenance for newly developed systems.

          <p class="description">
            As an intern at Raygun, I was part of a team that built the
            <code class="inline">React Native</code> library from scratch. This library was designed to integrate
            seamlessly with Raygun's comprehensive suite of crash reporting and monitoring software services. Working
            alongside another intern, we took this project from an initial concept to a fully functional tool,
            contributing directly to the enhancement of Raygun's offerings. This project marked my first professional
            experience and my introduction to an Agile working environment. The Agile methodology's iterative approach
            and focus on collaboration were instrumental in the library's development process. It allowed us to adapt
            quickly to changes, meet deadlines effectively, and ensure a high-quality end product. The result of our
            efforts is the "raygun4reactnative" library, now available on

            During my time as a Tutor at Victoria University, I provided support to students in Software Engineering,
            Networking Engineering, and Computer Science disciplines. My responsibilities focused on conducting
            after-class workshops and tutorials and included the precise marking of assignments based on established
            guides. This role afforded me the unique opportunity to master the art of conveying complex technical
            subjects (such as <code class="inline">C</code> pointers, <code class="inline">CPU</code> clock cycles and
            threads) to a diverse student body with varying degrees of technical proficiency. The ability to simplify
            and communicate intricate concepts effectively has been invaluable in my current career, where I engage
            effectively with business analysts, scrum masters, and product owners, facilitating clear and productive

          Adopting a 40% keyboard was a strategic move to safeguard my wrist health, influenced by an injury in my

          ergonomic choice has consequently boosted my productivity, as I can type for extended periods without strain.
          The efficiency gained from this compact design has been remarkable, allowing me to concentrate on my work with
          greater intensity and for longer durations. My enthusiasm for continuous learning and interest in ergonomic
          advancements motivates me to seek even more effective solutions. I'm dedicated to discovering cutting-edge
